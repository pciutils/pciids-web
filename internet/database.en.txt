The database consists of these tables:

Table of users
==============
Each line represents one user, be it the usual one without any
access rights or a privileged one. There there is information about
every user:
• Internal ID
• Email address
• XMPP address
• Login name
• Password hash
• Info about last login (for safety - show it on login) [can be empty]
• Time the system should gather email notifications before sending a
message
• Time the system should gather XMPP notifications before sending a
message
• Time of the next email message [can be empty when nothing pending]
• Time of the next XMPP message [can be empty when nothing pending]

Access rights table
===================
Contains all access rights above the normal. It does not need any data
with the normal users (which will be the most of them) and it is
possible to add new rights without restructuring the database.
Every line will contain:
• Internal users ID
• ID of the right (what this line allows to the user)
• Location (for rights applied locally) [can be empty, if it makes
no sense with the right]

Table of locations
==================
The locations are saved in a tree. ID of the location is created by
appending the local IDs of the nodes on the path together (children of
the root first), separated by '/'. Each node must know, how long are
the local IDs of its children.

(Note that the local IDs can contain '/', since it can be recognized
by its length.)

The first part is 2-letter specifier of information type. The first
version has these:
PC: PCI ID
PD: PCI Device Class

If there is some location ending by additional '/', it means the whole
subtree. If not, then it means the node only.

For every node, this information is stored:
• ID of the location (must be node only - without the additional '/')
• ID of referenced location (for symlinks) [can be empty]
• ID of the main article (see below) [can be empty]
• Name [Can be empty, should match the main article]
• Comment [Can be empty, should match the main article]

Table of history
================
Contains articles in the discussion.

• ID of the article
• ID of location, where it belongs
• Text
• Modification of the node name [can be empty, in that case can not be
the main article]
• Modification of the node comment [can be empty]

Table of notifications
======================
These are hooks for notifications.
• ID of the user
• ID of the location to which the notification should be sent.
• Notification type (New article, name or comment change, change of
the main article - everything contains all less common).
• Way of notification (Email, XMPP, Both)

Table of pending notifications
==============================
This is where all yet unsent notifications wait. They consist of these
fields:
• ID of the user
• ID of the article
• Way of notification (if both, it gets split into two notifications)
