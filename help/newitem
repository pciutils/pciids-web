Add a new item
<p>
If you know about an ID which is not listed in the database, you will be welcome
to submit it.
Just browse to the parent item and click on the <a href='$AC_URL$newitem'>add item</a> link.
If you want to change an existing entry, just <a href='$HELP_URL$newdiscuss'>post a discussion
item</a> instead.
<p>
To create a new entry, you need to fill in the ID and its name.
The ID is just the last part (without the parent part; for example if you have PCI device
<tt>1234:5678</tt> and the vendor <tt>1234</tt> already exists, you enter only <tt>5678</tt>).
If you know chip name, it is preferred over marketing name.
<p>
You can add some note to the name, for example, if the ID is not really owned by the company using it.
You can add a discussion comment to it (why you think it is correct).
The difference between note and discussion is that note is additional information to name, while discussion is administrative.
Also, note is sometimes distributed, while discussion isn't.
<p>
Both note and discussion is optional.
<p>
After you submit it, it will wait approval of an admin.

<h2>Approval</h2>
<p>
All submissions are checked by the administrators for errors. The admins either approve
the entry, or ask you to correct it or to provide more details. In cases of blatant
abuse (spam in comments etc.), they have the power to remove the entry completely.
