Add a new item
<p>
If you know about an ID not present here, you can submit it.
Browse to the item which should contain it and click <a href='$AC_URL$newitem'>add item</a> link.
<p>
You need to fill in the ID and its name.
The ID is just the last part (without parent part, for example if you have PCI device <tt>1234:5678</tt> and the vendor <tt>1234</tt> already exists, you enter only <tt>5678</tt>).
If you know chip name, it is preferred over marketing name.
<p>
You can add some note to the name, for example, if the ID is not really owned by the company using it.
You can add a discussion comment to it (why you think it is correct).
The difference between note and discussion is that note is additional information to name, while discussion is administrative.
Also, note is sometimes distributed, while discussion isn't.
<p>
Both note and discussion is optional.
<p>
After you submit it, it will wait approval of an admin.

<h2>Approval</h2>
<p>
Each item is checked and approved by an admin.
It is because not all submissions are correct.
<p>
If you want to it to get approved, please check you enter valid information into correct place (eg. not an USB ID into PCI devices, Device into its vendor).
You should check help specific for each tree:
<ul class='navigation'>
	<li><a href='$HELP_URL$pci'>PCI devices</a>
	<li><a href='$HELP_URL$pci_class'>PCI device classes</a>
</ul>
