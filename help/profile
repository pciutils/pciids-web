User profile
<p>
When you are logged in, you can find a <a href='$AC_URL$profile'>profile</a> link.
You can set various information about your account there:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Email</strong> ‒ this is the address to which email notifications about changes in the database will be sent.
	It is also used for logging in or for resetting your password.
	<li><strong>Login</strong> ‒ you can log in using this one instead of your email address.
	Furthermore, it is displayed along all discussion comments you wrote.
	<li><strong>Xmpp</strong> ‒ you can get notifications using xmpp (aka jabber) as well as email.
	<li><strong>Password</strong> ‒ if you want to set a new password, fill in both the new password and confirm password boxes.
	<li><strong>Batch times</strong> ‒ you can ask for having your notifications grouped together, so that you receive less messages.
	Enter a time in minutes.
</ul>

<h2>Password protected values</h2>
<p>
Email, login and the new password are protected by the old password.
If you want to change any of these, you must provide the old password to unlock them.
