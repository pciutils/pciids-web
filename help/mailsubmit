<p>
PCI IDs can be submited and edited using email.
There is a robot at address <a href='mailto:pci-ids@ucw.cz'>pci-ids@ucw.cz</a>, which accepts patches sent to it.
Please use unified diffs (<tt>diff -u</tt>) against the current <a href='/static/pci.ids'>pci.ids</a> file (preferably the one just downloaded from this page, but the robot tries hard to recognize older versions as well).
Avoid base64 encoding and mail agents converting tabs to spaces, breaking lines and so on.
<p>
If you do not have an <a href='$HELP_URL$account'>account</a> yet, one is created for your email address.
You will get subscribed to notifications about all the items you changed (if you like to tweak the notifications, look at their <a href='$HELP_URL$notifications'>documentation</a>.
<p>
Please note, the robot understands only PCI IDs. Other types of IDs must be entered by the web interface.
