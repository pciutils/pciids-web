Details
Could you please provide a more detailed description?

USB
This is a USB ID, not a PCI ID.

Device
This is a device, not a vendor.

Subsystem
This is a subsystem, not a device.

Doubt
I am not sure that this ID is correct. Could you please send us
a `lspci -vvx' dump for this device to pciids-devel@lists.sf.net?
